## Stock Price Prediction Model

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical data sourced from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library. The model leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to capture temporal dependencies in stock price data.

### Objective
The primary goal is to enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions, providing valuable insights for investors, traders, and financial analysts. By utilizing LSTM networks, the model aims to forecast future stock prices based on historical trends and patterns.

### Data Description
The dataset consists of historical stock prices for a specific company (e.g., Apple Inc. - AAPL). It includes daily records of the opening price, closing price, high, low, and trading volume.

### Tech Stack
- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries*: 
  - yfinance for data retrieval
  - pandas for data manipulation
  - numpy for numerical operations
  - scikit-learn for data preprocessing
  - TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the LSTM model

### Approach
1. *Data Collection*: Fetch historical stock price data using the yfinance library.
2. *Data Preprocessing*: 
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize the data
   - Create sequences for the LSTM model
3. *Model Building*: 
   - Construct the LSTM model using Keras
   - Define the architecture with appropriate layers and units
4. *Model Training*: 
   - Train the model on the preprocessed data
   - Use techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting
5. *Evaluation*: 
   - Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - Visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices

### Results
The model's predictions are evaluated against actual stock prices to determine its accuracy. Visualizations help in understanding the model's performance and identifying areas for improvement.

### Usage
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the training script: python train.py
4. Use the prediction script to forecast stock prices: python predict.py

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of LSTM networks in stock price prediction, highlighting the potential and challenges of using deep learning for financial forecasting.
